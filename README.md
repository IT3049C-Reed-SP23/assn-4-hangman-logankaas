## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:

This assignment was probably one of the hardest to complete so far for myself. I tried to write as much as I could while trying to understand what I am writing to work as well. There are some parts of the code that may not work properly and others that may work better. Overall, I believe I put the most effort I could into trying to make this project work. Therefore, I believe I deserve 18-19 points for this assignment. One or two points missing for some areas of missed work. 

## Self-Reflection:

This assignment was interesting and seemed to be much more in depth than the previous assignments watching every piece come together to make the Hangman project work. This assignment was much harder for myself than the other assignments and required more work than I had done on passed assignments previously. The assignment was interesting and enjoyable to work on.

### How long it took me to finish this?

This assignment took me roughly 5-6 hours to get to where I have it now.
